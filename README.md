# Neural-Network
The Neural_Network.py file is a simple Neural Network with Dense Connections.

# Sequence-Dense-Network
The Sequence_Dense_Network.py file is a network in which the input is a set of sequences. These sequences are dealt with using RNNs with LSTMs
The single outputs for each sequence type is then passed through a simple Neural Network with Dense Connections.
