# Neural-Network
The Neural_Network.py file is a dense Neural Network with Dense Connections. It is used for binary (0 or 1) classification. It is recommended to use 'binary_crossentropy' as loss_function and 'sigmoid' as the last hidden function.

# Classification-Model
The Classification_Model.py file is a dense Neural Network which can classify input into > 2 classes. It uses dense connections between the layers. It is recommended to use 'categorical_crossentropy' as loss_function and 'softmax' as the last hidden function.

# Sequence-Model
The Sequence_Model.py file is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

# Sequence-Dense-Network
The Sequence_Dense_Network.py file is a network in which the input is a set of sequences. These sequences are dealt with using RNNs with LSTMs
The single outputs for each sequence type is then passed through a simple Neural Network with Dense Connections.
